## Sr. Barbara's Class — Weekend Sprint

### Saturday Morning: Data Foundation

1. Get PostgreSQL accepting connections from Adminer (finish what we started)
2. Load schema.sql
3. Use Adminer to manually enter 5-10 seed sentences with their grammatical breakdowns (start with easy: "The dog runs." → subject/verb)

### Saturday Afternoon: API + Rendering

4. Update `/api/sentence` to return the full structure (tokens with their parts of speech, not just the sentence text)
5. Rewrite `drawDiagram()` to render words in correct Reed-Kellogg positions based on their grammatical roles

### Saturday Evening: Game Mechanic

6. Make words clickable — click a word, popup asks "what part of speech?"
7. Correct answer → word animates to its position on the diagram
8. Wrong answer → word stays put, Sr. Barbara has opinions

### Sunday: Polish + Submit

9. Add Sr. Barbara dialogue (text is fine, cartoon is nice-to-have)
10. Implement the Solve button (animates all words to correct positions)
11. Write your README for the contest submission
12. Test, commit, submit before 11:59 PM

### Nice-to-have if time permits:

- Words yelling "whee!!" during animation
- Sr. Barbara cartoon character
- Sound effects
- More sentences

The core loop is: fetch sentence → player identifies parts of speech → words slide into diagram. Everything else is decoration. Get that working first.
